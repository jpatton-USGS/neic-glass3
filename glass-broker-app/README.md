# glass-broker-app

**glass-broker-app** is an application that uses the glasscore libraries and the rest
of the glass3 infrastructure to generate seismic event detections based on
an input dataset of picks, correlations, and detections.

glass-broker-app reads it's input data from various kafka input topics
accessed via the hazdevbroker library.

glass-broker-app writes it's output detections to various kafka output topics
accessed via the hazdevbroker library.

glass-broker-app uses the environment variable `GLASS_LOG` to define the
location to write log files
