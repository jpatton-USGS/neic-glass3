# regional_example

This directory contains an example configuration of glass-app for a dataset of
automatic picks surrounding 107 earthquakes in the Central and Eastern United
States (CEUS) in 2017-2018.

The input data and an example of the output for this configuration is also
included.

Note that travel time files will need to be copied from [the repository](https://github.com/usgs/neic-glass3/tree/master/glasscore/traveltime/tt-files)
into this directory before running this example.
