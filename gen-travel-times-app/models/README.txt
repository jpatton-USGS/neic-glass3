Model files are so named because they deal with the Earth model.  The first time the 
travel-time code is run, it will create a properties file called traveltime.prop in 
a directory called Properties under the callers home directory.  This file should be 
edited so that the modelPath variable points to a directory where the model files will 
reside.  Note that eventPath is not used by the travel-time code.  The model files 
currently included are:

ak135.hed and ak135.tbl: These are travel-time table files generated by the FORTRAN 
   travel-time code for the ak135 model.  They are included for comparison purposes 
   only.

ellip.txt: Corrections for the ellipticity of the Earth.  These corrections are common 
   to all Earth models.

groups.txt: This specifies all possible phases in the current set up and their 
   relationship to each other.

mak135.mod: The ak135 Earth model which will drive the Java travel-time table 
   generation.  Ak135 is currently the NEIC global default.

mcia.mod: The Central Italian Apennines Earth model which will drive the Java travel-
   time table generation.  This model works in parts of California.

mcus.mod: The Central US Earth model which will drive the Java travel-time table 
   generation.  This model is useful east of the Rocky Mountains.

mogs.mod: The Oklahoma Geological Survey Earth model which will drive the Java 
   travel-time table generation.  This model is useful in Oklahoma which seems to 
   be somewhere between the Central and Western US models.

mwus.mod: The Western US Earth model which will drive the Java travel-time table 
   generation.  This model is useful west of the Great Plains.

phases.txt: This specifies the phase segments that will be created during the travel-
   time generation process.

topo.dat: A topographic map of the Earth that is used to compute bounce point 
   corrections.

ttstats.txt: Travel-time statistics, used to weight phases and generate "add-on" 
   phases.
