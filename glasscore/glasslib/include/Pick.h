 * \brief glasscore pick class
 *
 * The CPick class is the class that encapsulates everything necessary
 * to represent a waveform arrival pick, including arrival time, phase id,
 * and an unique identifier.  The CPick class is also a node in the
 * detection graph database.
 *
 * CPick contains functions to support nucleation of a new event based
 * on the pick.
 *
 * CPick maintains a graph database link between it and the the site (station)
 * the pick was made at.
 *
 * CPick also maintains a vector of CHypo objects represent the graph database
 * links between  this pick and various hypocenters.  A single pick may be
 * linked to multiple hypocenters
 *
 * CPick uses smart pointers (std::shared_ptr).
